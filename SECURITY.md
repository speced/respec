# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As ReSpec is generally delivered via a script tag, we only support patching the latest version of ReSpec. 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Generally, for low impact vulnerabilities, it's ok to simply file a bug. 

For high-priority things, email marcos at marcosc.com.
