      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <dfn>ReSpec</dfn> is a Javascript [[ECMA-262]] based tool that unobtrusively allows editors
        to write a specification focusing on the actual features and correctness, while needing to
        pay as little attention as possible to issues pertaining to styling, referential integrity,
        and the friendly dragon to slay that are the W3C Publication Rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many good existing tools that can be used to produce W3C specifications. A
        non-exhaustive list includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href='http://www.w3.org/2002/xmlspec/'>XMLSpec</a></li>
        <li><a href='http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/css3-src/bin/postprocess'>CSS3 Module PostProcessor</a></li>
        <li><a href='http://anolis.gsnedders.com/'>Anolis</a></li>
        <li><a href='http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/ReSpec/'>ReSpec</a> (Perl version)</li>
        <li>Many I forget...</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But I was dissatisfied with all of them, including the one I wrote. The primary reason for
        that was that they all require one to run a tool in between editing and reloading the
        browser — an extra step that at the end of a long day's work editing is one step too many.
        Beyond that there are some smaller issues that I personally have with each, but it is
        largely a matter of taste.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point I have applied at least cursory testing to this tool using Firefox 3.5, 
        Opera 10, and Safari 4. Without testing I would expect it to work in a reasonably recent
        Chrome, and not in any version of Internet Explorer (patches welcome).

    <section>
      <h2>Concepts</h2>
      <p>
        The fundamental ideas that underlie <a title='ReSpec'>ReSpec.js</a> are:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>It Just HTML</dt>
        <dd>
          You just edit HTML, with some extra convention but nothing extra. All the decoration is
          performed by the script, informed by some very basic configuration. There is a simple 
          <a href='template.html'>template</a> that you can use to get started.
        </dd>
        <dt>No Tool</dt>
        <dd>
          You never have to run a tool outside of your editor and browser. While the specification
          is being developed that's all that's needed. When a snapshot is needed for publication,
          all it takes is saving the generated DOM to a file (the script is very careful to cleanly
          remove itself and its dependencies so that you should normally get a document that's 
          PubRules-OK).
        </dd>
        <dt><acronym title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</acronym></dt>
        <dd>
          You shouldn't have to repeat anything within a specification, or across specifications
          (apart from the template). For instance, marking RFC 2119 keywords is automatic, the
          WebIDL support makes it possible to specify both the WebIDL and its documentation in
          the same place without repeating a single part of it, etc..
        </dd>
      </dl>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>General Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Most of what is described here will make a whole lot more sense if you look at the
        <a href='template.html'>template</a>'s source before you get started.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general structure of a <a>ReSpec</a> document is that of an HTML5 [[!HTML5]] document, with a
        few extra conventions so that the <a>ReSpec</a> processor may infer additional semantics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside <code>head</code>, the <code>title</code> element contains the title that will also
        be used to generate the <code>h1</code> in the specification's header. Then external <code>script</code>
        element loads in <a>ReSpec</a>, and another one inlines the basic configuration that it requires.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the <code>body</code>, each section of the specification is contained inside a
        <code>section</code> element. At least one of these MUST have an <code>id</code> of
        "abstract" (and MUST contain just the text of the abstract). Sections can be
        nested to any depth and are expected to have a heading title. Any of 
        <code>h2</code>-<code>h6</code> is acceptable as they will be automatically renamed to
        the <em>hN</em> applicable to that depth.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there is a <code>section</code> element with <code>id</code> "sotd" anywhere with the
        document, it will be removed, and its content will be inserted inside the <em>Status of
        this Document</em> as additional custom content.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there is a <code>section</code> element with <code>id</code> "conformance" in the document
        (and that element MAY be completely empty), it will be replaced with a template conformance
        section that mentions the RFC 2119 keywords and the such. If it has any content it will be
        appended after that template.
      </p>
      <p>
        During processing, <code>section</code> elements will be converted to <code>div</code>
        elements with <code>class</code> "section".
      </p>
      <p>
        Any section at the beginning that has a <code>class</code> of "introductory" will not
        be included in the Table of Contents. The first root-level section with a <code>class</code> of
        "appendix" will start the appendices section, labelled with letters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each <code>section</code> MAY have an <code>id</code> — if not, one will be generated
        based on the <code>textContent</code> of its heading.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any <code>section</code> that has a <code>class</code> of "informative" will be marked as
        "non-normative" in the output using the usual text.
      </p>
      <p>
        You MUST NOT create sections for the <em>Status of this Document</em>, the <em>ToC</em>, or
        the <em>References</em> as they will be automatically generated for you.
      </p>
<p>Same document references may be created using the following
  formatting:
<pre>
&lt;a href="#general-structure" class="sectionRef"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>(It is
  necessary for the explicit closing tag to be present.)
The class signals that this will be replaced with a link containing
  the section number and title as follows:
<pre>&lt;a href="#general-structure" class="sectionRef"&gt;section Section-Number Section-Title&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Configuration</h2>
      <p>
        The only part of <a>ReSpec</a> that isn't just straightforward HTML is the configuration, which
        thankfully is minimal (and a lot simpler than the HTML that it generates and which is
        required in all W3C specifications).
      </p>
      <p>
        The configuration is stored in a Javascript object called <code>respecConfig</code>.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>specStatus</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            This is the status of the document, as keyed in the following table. If in doubt,
            use <code>ED</code>.
          </p>
          <table class='simple'>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>key</th>
                <th>value</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr><td>NOTE</td><td>Note</td></tr>
              <tr><td>FPWD-NOTE</td><td>First Public WG Note</td></tr>
              <tr><td>WG-NOTE</td><td>Working Group Note</td></tr>
              <tr><td>CG-NOTE</td><td>Co-ordination Group Note</td></tr>
              <tr><td>IG-NOTE</td><td>Interest Group Note</td></tr>

              <tr><td>FPWD</td><td>First Public Working Draft</td></tr>
              <tr><td>WD</td><td>Working Draft</td></tr>
              <tr><td>LC</td><td>Last Call Working Draft</td></tr>
              <tr><td>CR</td><td>Candidate Recommendation</td></tr>
              <tr><td>PR</td><td>Proposed Recommendation</td></tr>
              <tr><td>PER</td><td>Proposed Edited Recommendation</td></tr>
              <tr><td>REC</td><td>Recommendation</td></tr>
              <tr><td>RSCND</td><td>Rescinded Recommendation</td></tr>
              <tr><td>unofficial</td><td>An unofficial draft. Use this if you're producing a document outside of W3C</td></tr>
              <tr><td>base</td><td>Just the basic template, not a specification</td></tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>
            The <code>specStatus</code> is used to pick the base style sheet, as well as to configure
            various parts of the specification's header and <em>Status of this Document</em>. Some of 
            the header notably depends on whether the specification is on "Rec-track", which is the
            case if the <code>specStatus</code> is one of: "FPWD", "WD", "LC", "CR", "PR", "PER", or "REC".
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>shortName</dt>
        <dd>
          The specification's short name, as in http://www.w3.org/TR/<strong>short-name</strong>/. Note
          that short names are assigned by the Director — ask your Team contact or Chair in advance of
          publication.
        </dd>
        <dt>subtitle</dt>
        <dd>
          W3C specifications have an optional subtitle that is displayed
          below the title in the heading section.  Define yours here if you have
          one.
        </dd>
        <dt>copyrightStart</dt>
        <dd>
          Some W3C specifications have a copyright that spans a range of years.
          You can specify the optional starting year with this parameter.
        </dd>
        <dt>publishDate</dt>
        <dd>
          When a draft is made ready for publication it is often done several days in advance. In that
          case, set this to the desired date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Otherwise comment it out, it'll 
          default to today.
        </dd>
        <dt>previousPublishDate</dt>
        <dd>
          If there is a previously published version of this draft, set this to its date in YYYY-MM-DD 
          format. If there isn't simply comment it out (or set it to a false value).
        </dd>
        <dt>previousMaturity</dt>
        <dd>
          If there is a previously published version of this draft, set this to its maturity level.
        </dd>
        <dt>previousURI</dt>
        <dd>
          If the previous version wasn't in the W3C TR space, you can supply an explicit URI.  If it
          is in TR space then the URI will be automatically determined.
        </dd>
        <dt>additionalCopyrightHolders</dt>
        <dd>
          If there are additional copyright holders in addition to the W3,
          they can be listed in this parameter. For example, if the copyright
          notice without <code>additionalCopyrightHolders</code> reads
          &quot;Copyright © 2009 W3C ... &quot; then with  
          &quot;Foo&quot; listed it will read &quot;Copyright © 2009 Foo &amp;
          W3C ... &quot;. 
        </dd>
        <dt>edDraftURI</dt>
        <dd>
          If there a publicly available Editor's Draft, this is the link to it. This will typically be
          the link to the CVS version of the document you're editing.
        </dd>
        <dt>lcEnd</dt>
        <dd>
          If the draft is a Last Call WD it needs to have a review period with a given end date. This is
          that date in YYYY-MM-DD format. This is otherwise ignored.
        </dd>
        <dt>crEnd</dt>
        <dd>
          If the draft is a Candidate Recommendation it needs to have an end date that is the promised
          <em>minimal</em> date before which it will not transition to PR. This is that date in YYYY-MM-DD format. 
          This is otherwise ignored.
        </dd>
        <dt>prevRecShortname</dt>
        <dd>If there is an earler version of this specification at the
          Recommendation level, set this to the shortname of that
          version. This is
          optional and not usually necessary.
        <dt>extraCSS</dt>
        <dd>
          This is an array that contains URI references (that may be absolute or relative) to additional
          CSS style sheets that you may wish to be loaded into the document. It is RECOMMENDED that you
          include <code>http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/ReSpec.js/css/respec.css</code> as one of those, though
          you may of course skip it and take care of the additional styles yourself.
        </dd>
        <dt>editors</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            An array describing editors that contains objects with the following fields:
          </p>
          <table class='simple'>
            <thead>

          <p>
            At least one editor is required, and you can have as many as you want. They will be displayed
            in the provided order. There are two conventions usually
            applied within W3C: by alphabetical 
            order of last name, or of first name — choose whichever
            applies to your WG. Sometimes one 
            editor who stands out as having contributed far more than
            most is placed first. 
          </p>
          <p>
            A note may be used to display additional relevant
            information, such as the specific release the editor
            worked on, for example. This could be done by  setting
            note to &quot;2nd Edition&quot;, for example: 
                  <dl><dt>Mr Example, Foo Company ( 2nd Edition )</dt></dl>
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>authors</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            An array describing authors that contains objects with
            fields for each author. The format and definitions of the
            fields are the same as for editors.
          <p>
            Use of authors is entirely optional,none are required. You
            can have as many authors as you want. Display is the same
            as described for editors.

          If specified, is an integer used to indicate the maximum depth of the ToC. The depth is the
          number of numbering levels, so for instance 4.19.5 is at depth 3. The first level is always
          included in the ToC (otherwise there would be no ToC).
        </dd>

        <dd>
          If this parameter is set, ReSpec.js will embed various RDFa attributes throughout 
          the generated specification.  The triples generated use vocabulary items from the dcterms, 
          foaf, and bibo.  The parameter defaults to false.  If set to true
          the system will generate RDFa 1.0 content.  If set to "1.1" it will
          generate RDFa 1.1 content.

        <dd>
          By default, the generated WebIDL is produced in the order in which it is in the document, but
          the generated HTML descriptions that match are sorted (this behaviour matches that found in
          the DOM specifications). Setting this option to true causes the generated HTML to also be in
          document order.

        <dd>
          Historically, IDL parameters have all started with "in", as inherited from OMG IDL. In WebIDL

      <h2>Table of Contents &amp; Numbering</h2>
      <p>
        The <acronym title='Table of Contents'>ToC</acronym> is generated entirely for you, so long as
        you are careful to stick to the following simple rules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sections are contained inside <code>section</code> elements</li>
        <li>The first element child of a section MUST be a <code>h<var>n</var></code> element containing its title</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sections can be nested to any depth. Any of <code>h2</code>-<code>h6</code> is acceptable for
        their required title as they will be automatically renamed to the <em>hN</em> applicable to that depth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any section at the beginning that has a <code>class</code> of "introductory" will not
        be included in the Table of Contents. The first root-level section with a <code>class</code> of
        "appendix" will start the appendices section, labelled with letters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each <code>section</code> MAY have an <code>id</code> — if not, one will be generated
        based on the <code>textContent</code> of its heading (the algorithm was taken with minor
        modification from Anolis).
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>RFC 2119</h2>
      <p>
        Any editor who wishes to do a good job MUST have read RFC 2119 [[!RFC2119]]. This 
        <acronym title='Request For Comments'>RFC</acronym> defines a number of keywords that have a specific
        meaning in a standards context.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a>ReSpec</a> recognises the full list of keywords (MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL
        NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL) without requiring any specific
        markup. They only need to be in uppercase so as to distinguish them from the regular
        usage of such words that may otherwise occur.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Definitions</h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>definition</dfn> is a term that is specified or clarified for the specific use of the
        given specification. It is created using the <code>dfn</code> element. The terms being defined
        will be either and in order (as per slightly enriched [[!HTML5]]):
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>the <code>title</code> attribute of the <code>dfn</code> element</li>
        <li>
          the <code>title</code> attribute of the only child element of <code>dfn</code> when it is 
          <code>abbr</code> or <code>acronym</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          the <code>textContent</code> of the <code>dfn</code> element
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <a title='definition'>Definitions</a> can then be referred to using an <code>a</code> element
        (as per [[!HTML5]]) without an <code>href</code> attribute (it will be added). As in this paragraph,
        the <code>title</code> attribute can be used to provide the exact term to which the reference
        is being made.
      </p>
      <p>
        When referring to a term defined in another specification, the <code>a</code> element without
        <code>href</code> is still to be used, but with a <code>class</code> set to "externalDFN".
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>References</h2>
      <p>
        Specifications make two kinds of references: normative and informative (sometimes referred to as
        "non-normative" or "other references"). Reference maintenance is always painful, and will 
        regularly go out of synch.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a>ReSpec</a> relies on an <a href='bibref/biblio.js'>external database of references</a> stored as the
        <code>berjon.biblio</code> Javascript object. The keys to that database are the terms used to
        refer to a given specification, and the values the <acronym title='HyperText Markup Language'>HTML</acronym>
        that is inserted. The contents of that database were originally extracted from the database in
        Refer format that is part of the CSS3 Module Preprocessor but is now maintained separately.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wish to acces an automatically generated HTML version of the biblio DB you can get it
        <a href='biblio.html'>in the biblio.html file</a>, but be warned that this may be slow to 
        render. Using the initial JS document is often easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you notice that a given entry is missing or out of date, you may patch it directly in CVS,
        or contact Robin to update it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to insert an informative reference, look for its code in the database and use the
        following syntax: <code>[<!---->[CODE]]</code>. This will produce a result like the following: [[DAHUT]].
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, in order to insert a normative reference, look for its code in the database and use the
        same syntax but with a "!" in front of the code: <code>[<!---->[!CODE]]</code>. This will produce
        a result like the following: [[!ELEMENTTRAVERSAL]].
      </p>
<p>If the <code>refNote</code> parameter is defined then a paragraph will be
  created in the References section with the content of that
  parameter, as noted in the Configuration section.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Abbreviations</h2>
      <p>
        <a>ReSpec</a> supports both <code>abbr</code> and <code>acronym</code> (and really doesn't want to hear
        about the debate concerning these two — if you have a side, use whatever makes you happy). Once an
        abbreviation is defined anywhere inside the document using one of these two elements and its <code>title</code>
        attribute, any occurrence of the same abbreviation anywhere else in the body of the specification will
        see itself wrapped automatically in the same element, with the same <code>title</code>. You can therefore
        define an abbreviation thus: <acronym title='Devious Application of Hibernation to Ukulele Trolling'>DAHUT</acronym>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that thanks the standard header, some abbreviations like W3C or ERCIM are always defined, while others
        such as DAHUT come from the rest of the content.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Best Practice Documents</h2>
      <p>
<p>Best practices may be shown, numbered and formatted using the
  following formatting:
  <pre class='example'>
    &lt;div class="practice"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;span id="sample-practice" class="practicelab"&gt;Title of the practice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="practicedesc"&gt;
        More detailed decription of the practice.          
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  </pre>
    <div class="practice">
      <p>
        <span id="sample-practice" class="practicelab">Title of the practice</span></p>
      <p class="practicedesc">
        More detailed decription of the practice.          
      </p>
    </div>
<p>If a <code>section</code> element with <code>id</code> "bp-summary" is
  present, then a summary 
  list of best practices will be placed in it, linked to the best
  practices that have an id on the <code>span</code> element.</p>
<pre class="example">
  &lt;section id='bp-summary'&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
</pre>
</section>

    <section>
      <h2>Including other data</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes a specification will need to incorporate data that is best kept in
        an external file (e.g., an XML Schema implementation of the datatypes would be in an 
        '.xsd' file, but should also be in-line in the spec).  <a>ReSpec</a> permits this 
        by allowing inclusion of arbitrary external data and also allowing optional 
        transformation of that data.
      </p>
      <p>
        To reference an external resource, define the resource via the <code>data-include</code> 
        attribute (e.g., <code>&lt;div data-include='myDatatypes.xsd'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> ).
        The contents of the element with that attribute will be replaced with the data read from
        the file.
      </p>
      <p>
        To perform one or more transformations on the contents before they are placed in
        the document, specify the names of transformation methods via the <code>data-oninclude</code>
        attribute (e.g., <code>&lt;div data-include='myDatatypes.xsd' data-oninclude='updateSchema'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> ).
        Each whitespace separated method named will be called and passed
        two parameters: the <code>berjon.respec</code> object and the contents of the 
        resource retrieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's a simple transformation method:
      </p>
      <pre class='example'>
function updateExample(doc, content) {
    // perform transformations to make it render and prettier
    return '&lt;pre class="example">' + doc._esc(content) + '&lt;/pre>';
}
      </pre>
</section>

    <section>
      <h2>Transforming data</h2>
      <p>
        Another thing you might want to do is transform arbitrary content in 
        your document (for example, to ensure that content within an 'example' 
        block is escaped).  You can do this via the <code>data-transform</code>.
        Just like the <code>data-oninclude</code> attribute above, this allows
        you to specify a whitespace separated list of method names.  Each will be called
        and passed two parameters: the <code>berjon.respec</code> object and the contents of
        the element.
      </p>
      <p>Here is an example, using the same method as above:</p>
      <pre class='example'>
function updateExample(doc, content) {
    // perform transformations to make it render and prettier
    return '&lt;pre class="example">' + doc._esc(content) + '&lt;/pre>';
}
      </pre>
      <p>And then the content:</p>
      <pre class='example'>
        &lt;pre class='example' data-transform='updateExample'&gt;
        &lt;html&gt;
        ...
        &lt;/html&gt;
        &lt;/pre&gt;
      </pre>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>WebIDL Support</h2>
      <p>
        WebIDL [[!WEBIDL]] is the language that is used to define <acronym title='Application Programming Interface'>API</acronym>s
        inside W3C specifications. It is powerful and very expressive, and at this stage <a>ReSpec</a>
        only supports a limited (but hopefully useful) subset of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The issues with editing WebIDL directly in documents are as follow:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>While evolving, it is easy to get the WebIDL proper and the accompanying prose out of sync</li>
        <li>Proper linking from WebIDL to content and back is often too tedious to be done in full</li>
        <li>Syntax highlighting is generally given up on</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a>ReSpec</a> does its best to provide all three of the above at a minimal cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently only interface and exception definitions are supported, and on them only the
        simple variants of attributes, constants, and operations (with extended attributes 
        everywhere). Additional features will be added on a need-to-be-done basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        The approach is simple. An interface is defined using a <code>dl</code> element, with a <code>class</code>
        of "idl" and the <code>title</code> of which is the defining line for the interface, for
        instance <code>[Constructor] interface Dahut : Mammal, Cryptoid</code> or
        <code>exception Boom</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the <code>dl</code>, each <code>dt</code>/<code>dd</code> pair defines an interface
        member (attribute, constant, or operation). The content of the <code>dt</code> element is the line
        that defines the member (e.g. <code>readonly attribute DOMString chirality</code> or
        <code>void yell ([AllowAny] in unsigned long volume, [TreatNullAs=EmptyString] in DOMString sentence)</code>);
        and the <code>dd</code> element contains the description.
      </p>
      <p>
        This format has the advantage of keeping information well-grouped together, using HTML
        markup for the most part (so that even WYSIWYG editors can be used), while being simple
        to parse and sufficiently expressive for most needs (especially as more features are
        added).
      </p>
      <p>
        The output that is generated replaces the <code>dl</code> with a syntax-highlighted and linked
        WebIDL segment with all the members for the given interface in the order in which they were
        defined; followed by two subsections listing respectively attributes and methods in alphabetical
        order (further details will progressively be added to those descriptions).
      </p>
      <p>
        An example will probably speak more clearly; the following simple code:
      </p>
      <pre class='example sh_html'>&lt;dl title='[Constructor] interface Dahut : Mammal, Cryptoid' class='idl'>
  &lt;dt>const unsigned short LEVROGYROUS = 0&lt;/dt>
  &lt;dd>
    Turning left.
  &lt;/dd>
  &lt;dt>const unsigned short DEXTROGYROUS = 1&lt;/dt>
  &lt;dd>
    Turning right.
  &lt;/dd>
  &lt;dt>readonly attribute DOMString chirality&lt;/dt>
  &lt;dd>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor (...)
  &lt;/dd>
  &lt;dt>attribute unsigned long age&lt;/dt>
  &lt;dd>
     Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip (...)
  &lt;/dd>
  &lt;dt>Dahut turnAround (in float angle, in boolean fall)&lt;/dt>
  &lt;dd>
    Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat (...)
  &lt;/dd>
  &lt;dt>unsigned long trip ()&lt;/dt>
  &lt;dd>
    Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit (...)
  &lt;/dd>
  &lt;dt>void yell ([AllowAny] in unsigned long volume, [TreatNullAs=EmptyString] in DOMString sentence)&lt;/dt>
  &lt;dd>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt (...)
  &lt;/dd>
&lt;/dl></pre>
      <p>
        Will produce the following WebIDL section with links and syntax highlighting, as well as the two
        following subsections that list attributes and methods:
      </p>
      <dl title='[Constructor] interface Dahut : Mammal, Cryptoid' class='idl'>
        <dt>const unsigned short LEVROGYROUS = 0</dt>

      <h2>Saving the Generated Specification</h2>
      <p>
        Of course the downside of the approach taken by <a>ReSpec</a> is that the specification as it is
        expected to be, with all its bells and whistles, exists only in your browser's memory. Publishing
        directly with the script would not work as it does not work for all browsers (and there are still
        quite a few people using Internet Explorer out there) and would not show all the content for
        search indexing. And sadly enough browsers aren't very good at saving HTML that's been modified 
        by script.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution that is used here is that you hit the <code>Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S</code> key combination (this is
        subject to change until we agree on an option we all like). That will show a menu offering to either 
        "Save as HTML", "Save as HTML (Source)", "Save as XHTML", or "Save as XHTML (Source)". You can hit <code>Esc</code> to hide it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those options are very similar. The non-source ones open a new window (which may be in a new tab depending
        on your configuration) and shows you a document that should look exactly the same as the one you're
        editing. That's normal. The difference is that it's a static document that represents the same DOM
        tree as the live one after <a>ReSpec</a> has run. That page you can then save using your browser's
        vanilla saving mechanism (be sure to refuse any option that tries to save the complete page with
        images and other dependencies — you want just the (X)HTML). The "Source" alternative shows you the same
        page's source code so that you can paste it into your favourite editor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that some browsers will still save the original document when you use the non-Source alternative,
        so if in doubt use the Source alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently only HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 are supported.
        HTML5 is not supported because it is currently rejected
        by PubRules.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea is that such snapshots would be created only when actual official W3C publication is
        required — all the while that the specification is an Editor's Draft it should simply live
        as itself.
        </p>
        <p>The tool is also capable of producing a diff-marked version.  
        , but if you have a configuration setting of
        'previousDiffURI' set to a document to compare to
        When selected, the tool will use special configuration
        parameter 'previousDiffURI' (or the previousURI if
        previousDiffURI is not defined) and the current content to produce
        a diffmarked version by passing parameters 'oldfile' and
        'newcontent' to the diff tool.  It also sets the 'base' parameter.
        By default, the diff tool is set to
        http://www.aptest.com/standards/htmldiff/htmldiff.pl.  You can
        override this with the configuration parameter 'diffTool'.

      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>
        The source code of this very document makes use of many <a>ReSpec</a> features. It provides a good starting
        point for examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally there is a <a href='test-spec/index.html'>test specification</a> that exercises all
        features at least in part, and can therefore be studied to see different aspects of <a>ReSpec</a> in action.
