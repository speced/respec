        The W3C Core Mobile Web Platform Community Group was established with the objective of helping to make the Web a compelling platform for developing modern mobile applications. The motivation for that is the widespread view that the Web does not represent a compelling platform for mobile applications today.

        This document presents a small number of simple mobile Web application use cases. It goes on to list features that the underlying mobile Web platform needs to offer to support those use cases. It then lists technology standards (primarily W3C Recommendations) that describe those features - and also notes the current state of development of such specifications, noting also where such specification do not at present exist.

        The purpose of the document is to promote understanding of which areas of Web technology are in need of development, and to encourage prioritization of those areas for specification, implementation and testing.

        Other aspects of the Community Group's work, which includes the collation and specification of test suites to assess conformance to referenced standards, and the specification of a framework within which such conformance testing might be assessed are referenced.

    Introduction
    ============


    ### `<item>`


    ```Javascript
    <item> => {
          state: 'updated' | 'deleted',
          kind: "session",
          id: "{21EC2020-3AEA-4069-A2DD-08002B303123}",
          modified: Date(a),
          data: <data> 
       }
    ```


    | Key | Description |
    | --- | ----------- |
    | state | Deleted items are included in the response with a "deleted" state, but no `<data>` associated. |
    | kind | The "kind" attribute allows for the representation of different entity types. The standard does not advocate embedding of child entities if they change more frequently than the parent. Each entity type ("kind") can be synchronised separately, this allows us to decouple the sync logic from the data structure, and allows us to reassemble the data structure on the client side. It also makes the implementation very simple. |
    | id | Although IDs shown here are GUIDs, and above are numeric, and although the example above shows Unix timestamps, the standard does not prescribe any specific format of either. |
    | modified | Modified timestamp of the item. Must be comparable to itself. |
    | data | Note this key is not included if state is `'deleted'` |
