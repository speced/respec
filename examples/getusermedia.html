    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Access to multimedia streams (video, audio, or both) from local devices
    (video cameras, microphones, Web cams) can have a number of uses, such as
    real-time communication, recording, and surveillance.</p>

    <p>This document defines the APIs used to get access to local devices that
    can generate multimedia stream data. This document also defines the MediaStream
    API by which JavaScript is able to manipulate the stream data or otherwise
    process it.</p>

        <dd>
          <p>A source is the "thing" providing the source of a media stream
          track. The source is the broadcaster of the media itself. A
          source can be a physical webcam, microphone, local video or
          audio file from the user's hard drive, network resource, or
          static image.</p>

          <p>Some sources have an identifier which <em title="must"
          class="rfc2119">must</em> be unique to the application
          (un-guessable by another application) and persistent between
          application sessions (e.g., the identifier for a given
          source device/application must stay the same, but not be
          guessable by another application). Sources that must have an
          identifier are camera and microphone sources; local file
          sources are not required to have an identifier. Source
          identifiers let the application save, identify the
          availability of, and directly request specific sources.</p>

          <p>Other than the identifier, other bits of source identity
          are <strong>never</strong> directly available to the
          application until the user agent connects a source to a
          track. Once a source has been "released" to the application
          (either via a permissions UI, pre-configured allow-list, or
          some other release mechanism) the application will be able
          discover additional source-specific capabilities.</p>

          <p>Sources <strong>do not</strong> have constraints --
          tracks have constraints. When a source is connected to a
          track, it must conform to the constraints present on that
          track (or set of tracks).</p>

          <p>Sources will be released (un-attached) from a track when
          the track is ended for any reason.</p>

          <p>On the <code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code> object,
          sources are represented by a <code><a>sourceType</a></code>
          attribute. The behavior of APIs associated with the source's
          capabilities and state change depending on the source
          type.</p>

          <p>Sources have <code><a>capabilities</a></code>
          and <code><a>state</a></code>. The capabilities and state
          are "owned" by the source and are common to any (multiple)
          tracks that happen to be using the same source (e.g., if two
          different tracks objects bound to the same source ask for
          the same capability or state information, they will get back
          the same answer).</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><dfn title="state">State (Source State)</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>State refers to the immediate, current value of the
          source's (optionally constrained) capabilities. State is
          always read-only.</p>
          <p>A source's state can change dynamically over time due to
          environmental conditions, sink configurations, or constraint
          changes. A source's state must always conform to the current
          set of mandatory constraints that all of the tracks it is
          bound to have defined, and should do its best to conform to
          the set of optional constraints specified.</p>
          <p>A source's state is directly exposed to audio and video
          track objects through individual read-only attributes. These
          attributes share the same name as their
          corresponding <a>capabilities</a>
          and <a>constraints</a>.</p>
          <p>Events are available that signal to the application that
          source state has changed.</p>
          <p>A conforming user-agent <em title="must"
          class="rfc2119">must</em> support all the state names
          defined in this spec.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><dfn title="capabilities"
        id="dfn-capabilities">Capabilities</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Source capabilities are the intrinsic "features" of a
          source object. For each source state, there is a
          corresponding capability that describes whether it is
          supported by the source and if so, what the range of
          supported values are. Capabilities are expressed as either a
          series of states (for enumerated-type capabilities) or as a
          min/max range.</p>
          <p>The values of the supported capabilities must be
          normalized to the ranges and enumerated types defined in
          this specification.</p>
          <p>Capabilities return the same underlying per-source
          capabilities, regardless of any user-supplied constraints
          present on the source (capabilities are independent of
          constraints).</p>
          <p>Source capabilities are effectively
          constant. Applications should be able to depend on a
          specific source having the same capabilities for any
          session.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><dfn title="constraints"
        id="dfn-constraints">Constraints</dfn></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Constraints are an optional feature for restricting the
          range of allowed variability on a source. Without provided
          constraints, implementations are free to select a source's
          state from the full range of its supported capabilities, and
          to adjust that state at any time for any reason.</p>

          <p>Constraints may be optional or mandatory. Optional
          constraints are represented by an ordered list, mandatory
          constraints are an unordered set. The order of the optional
          constraints is from most important (at the head of the list)
          to least important (at the tail of the list).</p>

          <p>Constraints are stored on the track object, not the
          source. Each track can be optionally initialized with
          constraints, or constraints can be added afterward through
          the constraint APIs defined in this spec.</p>

          <p>Applying track level constraints to a source is
          conditional based on the type of source. For example,
          read-only sources will ignore any specified constraints on
          the track.</p>

          <p>It is possible for two tracks that share a unique source
          to apply contradictory constraints. Under such
          contradictions, the implementation will mute both tracks and
          notify them that they are over-constrained.</p>

          <p>Events are available that allow the application to know
          when constraints cannot be met by the user agent. These
          typically occur when the application applies constraints
          beyond the capability of a source, contradictory
          constraints, or in some cases when a source cannot sustain
          itself in over-constrained scenarios (overheating,
          etc.).</p>

          <p>Constraints that are intended for video sources will be
          ignored by audio sources and vice-versa. Similarly,
          constraints that are not recognized will be preserved in the
          constraint structure, but ignored by the UA. This
          will allow future constraints to be defined in a backward
          compatible manner.</p>

          <p>A correspondingly-named constraint exists for each
          corresponding source state name and capability name.  In
          general, user agents will have more flexibility to optimize
          the media streaming experience the fewer constraints are
          applied.</p>

              "medium" and "full", then the user agent should map the

        <h2>Isolated Media Streams</h2>
        
        <p>When either the "noaccess" or "peerIdentity" constraints is
          applied to a MediaStreamTrack, the track shall be isolated so that its
          content is not accessible to the content JS. An isolated media stream
          may be used for two purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Displayed in an appropriate tag (e.g., a video or audio element).
              The video element MUST have a unique origin so that it is
              inaccessible to the content JS. This is the same security mechanism
              as is used with an ordinary audio or video element which has
              a src= property from a separate origin.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Used as the argument to addStream() for a PeerConnection, subject
              to the restrictions detailed in the WebRTC document.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When the noaccess=true constraint applies to a track, that track
          may be added to any PeerConnection.
        </p>

        <p class="note"> Open Issue: The editors worry that the above paragraph
        is just wrong. If the track can be added to a PeerConnection that
        is connect to another PeerConenction in the same application, the
        application could get access to the data. We sugest this should be changed
        from "may be added" to "may not be added". This will allow noaccess=true
        to be used for things like hair check dialogs. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          When the peerIdentity=foo constraint applies to a track, then
          that track may be added only to PeerConnections with compatible
          peer identities as described in the WebRTC document.
        </p>

        <p>
          Both the noaccess and peerIdentity constraints must be mandatory.
          Any use of them in the optional block must trigger an error.
