  ## New stuff in ReSpec!

  ... we have been busy! üèãÔ∏è‚Äç

</section>


## Contributor and stats

  - We've had 37 new contributors project.
  - Supports numerous students - GSoC, Outreachy



## Now in two flavours
ReSpec now comes into flavors:

  - üçè respec-w3c.js
    - 327Kb - (93Kb) gzip

  - üçé respec-w3c-common.js
    - includes jQuery
    - 416Kb (123Kb) gzip

  - Significant speed improvements via IDB caching + cache api.

## "xref" - Automatic references linking
We added a new way of linking to terms defined in other specs, which is a lot more cleaner and less cumbersome. The following snippet shows the difference between the old and new way of linking to external terms. [[Full Documentation](https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki/xref)]

```html
<!-- before -->
<a data-cite="URL#concept-url-parser">
  URL parser
</a>
<code>
  <a data-cite="HTML/webappapis.html#eventhandler">
    EventHandler
  </a>
</code>

<!-- after -->
<a>URL parser</a>
{{ EventHandler }}
```

### How it works?

tl;dr: We created a search API over CSS Working Group's Shepherd APIs.

  - HTTP API
    - https://respec.org/xref
    - Integrates CSSWG's Shepherd API via [tabatkins/bikeshed-data](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed-data).
    - Links definitions exported from a spec (which have `data-export`).
  - ReSpec
    - Collect terms to link and along with their _contextual information_.
    - Send request to the API.
    - Link terms.
    - Profit.

### How to use xref?
Earlier, to link to [URL parser](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-parser) defined in [[URL]] spec, we had to write `<a data-cite="URL#concept-url-parser">URL parser</a>`.
Now we can write `<a>URL parser</a>` or `[\= URL parser =]` (`\` added to prevent automatic linking in this document, for demonstration).

We have to tell ReSpec in which specs we want to search the definitions for. Set `respecConfig.xref = ["url"]` to let ReSpec know that we want to link to terms defined in [[URL]] spec. Now it will search for terms and link them. You can write spec shortnames as well as spec IDs, though shortnames are preferred.

We can also link to IDL terms using **IDL Linking micro-syntax**. Instead of writing `<code><a data-cite="HTML/webappapis.html#eventhandler">EventHandler</a></code>`, we can write `{{\ EventHandler }}` (but don't forget to change [`respecConfig.xref`](https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki/xref) to `["url", "html"]`).

A whitespace-separated list of specs can be added on <code>&lt;body></code> as: <code>&lt;body data-cite="url html"></code>, instead of adding it in `respecConfig.xref`.

We also support nested contextual linking, for example, `{{\ EventTarget.addEventListener(type, callback) }}` will link to both EventTarget interface as well as addEventListener method on EventTarget.

Note: Keep in mind that the IDL linking micro-syntax is case sensitive.

It may become a little cumbersome to specify all the specs we want to search in. We also support profiles that expand to list of specs. Setting `respecConfig.xref = "web-platform"` is equivalent to `respecConfig.xref = ["HTML", "INFRA", "URL", "WEBIDL", "DOM", "FETCH"]`. At the time of writing, only "web-platform" profile is supported.


### Context

We can provide search context in 3 ways:

- Which spec(s)?
- What type: IDL (interface, attribute, ...), Concept (dfn, event, element)
- `data-dfn-for` AKA "for context"


#### spec context

We can write specs to search using `data-cite` attributes. Go through the following example as an explanation.

```html
<section data-cite="dom html">
  <h2>section 1</h2>
  <p>
    <a id="link1">event handler</a>:
      - will be searched in either [dom] or [html] (closest data-cite)
  </p>
  <section data-cite="dom">
    <p data-cite="svg">
      <a id="link2">event handler</a>
        - will be first searched in [svg]
        - then the search will fallback to [dom]
        - then the search will fallback to [dom], [html]
        (all will be done in a single request, so it's fast)
    </p>
    <p>
      If you provide a `data-cite` directly on `&lt;a>`, fallback won't be used:
      <a id="link3" data-cite="fetch">event handler</a>:
        - search for "event handler" in [fetch], which fails.
        - the element will link to [fetch] for backward compatibility.
        - an error will be shown saying the term couldn't be found.
    </p>
  </section>
</section>

<section data-cite="html">
  <h2>section 2</h2>
  <p>
    We can also use the inline `[[\ spec ]]` biblio reference syntax to create context.
    Here, [[css-scoping]] is to create context for <a id="link4">shadow root</a>
  </p>
</section>
```

#### "for" context

Some terms are defined only in certain contexts (`data-dfn-for`) and they can't be treated as "global" for linking purposes. We can use the inline micro-syntax to provide "for context" as:

```html
<!-- the left side of `/` provides context, the right side is the term -->
[=set / For each=]
[=map / for each =]
[=Event/stop propagation flag=]

<!-- works the same way with IDL syntax -->
{{ Window/event }} // event attribute of Window interface
{{ Window.event }} // `.` provides context, and links to both Window and event
{{ EventTarget/addEventListener(type, callback) }}
```



#### type context

The IDL micro-syntax allows providing type information when needed.

```html
Attribute/method: {{Event/srcElement}}

Exception: {{ "NotAllowedError" }}

Enum: {{ ReferrerPolicy / "no-referrer" }}

Element: [^script^]
```


### Aliasing

Sometimes, a term may be defined in a spec in a way to which linking as it is may not make sense grammatically or other way. The linking micro-syntax allow aliasing a term.

```html
[= code point| Unicode code point =]
<!-- links to "code point" but renders it as "Unicode code point" -->
[=set / For each | for every =]
<!-- links to set-iterate (set:for each) but renders it as "for every" -->

{{ "NotAllowedError" | don't do this }}
<!-- aliasing IDL terms is not allowed. -->
```

### Error messages

ReSpec will provide helpful error messages when terms fail to link. Each error (accessible via the ReSpec pill in top-right corner of page) will link to the location of erroneous term. A link will also be provided in error message which may help in resolving the error. In general, following kind of errors are possible:

```html
<p data-cite="html svg2">
  Ambiguous Definition: defined in multiple specs: [^script^].
  Defined in both [html] and [svg2].
  Resolution: Provide a stricter data-cite.
</p>
<p data-cite="html dom url">
  No such term found: [= foobar =]
  Term not found. Possible reasons:
    - the data-cite asked to search in wrong specs.
    - the context was too strict.
    - the term isn't exported from the spec.
      - Verify the spec exports the term.
      - Contact us or the spec author.
    - our database (Shepherd) doesn't have it. Create an issue on GitHub.
</p>
<p data-cite="service-workers">
  Defined in multiple ways in a single spec: [= request =]
  Not enough context to understand. Provide context:
    - [=cache batch operation/request=]
    - {{FetchEventInit/request}}
    - {{FetchEvent/request}}
</p>
```

### xref search UI

As we kinda created a search engine for the terms in Shepherd database, we also added a UI to make it easy to search for them.

The UI can be accessed in following ways:

  - via the ReSpec pill
    - Click the ReSpec pill in top-right corner of page
    - Select "Search definitions"
  - or, visit https://respec.org/xref/


## Web IDL linking

We added several features using Web IDL parser library named
[webidl2.js](https://github.com/w3c/webidl2.js/) and the first of them is
automatic IDL linking.

<pre class="idl" data-cite="webidl html dom">
  [Exposed=Window]
  interface LinkWorksEvent: Event {
    void makeLinkWork(EventInit init);
    attribute HTMLLinkElement link;
  };
</pre>

webidl2.js detects that this IDL block has several identifiers that needs
linking, and then it uses the cross reference feature we mentioned earlier to
link them to the relevant lines of their specifications. Here we have `Event`
to DOM and `HTMLLinkElement` to HTML, and you can click them to navigate to
their relevant specifications.

<pre class="idl" data-cite="html">
  [Exposed=Window]
  partial interface Navigator {};
</pre>

ReSpec also supports linking partial types. Here, you can click `Navigator` to
navigate to the relevant section of HTML.

## IDL self-definition

<pre class="idl">
  [Exposed=Window]
  interface TryLinkingToMe {};
</pre>

Previously we had to provide a proper `<dfn>` element when we define any IDL
types. Now you can skip it if you are sure you don't need one and prefer
simpler document structure. We still recommends you to provide a good
explanation for your IDL types with `<dfn>` whenever possible.

```
<dfn>TryLinkingToMe</dfn> // This is now optional
<a>TryLinkingToMe</a> // Linking is now possible without <dfn>
```

## Web IDL validations

One of the best feature frow webidl2.js is validation! It's easy to write
invalid IDL because specification authors are not always IDL experts. Also, the
Web IDL specification itself can change in a breaking way. The
validation feature in ReSpec helps fixing IDL when that happens.


### Duplicate identifiers

<pre class="idl">
  // No duplicate ids allowed!
  [Exposed=Window]
  interface Duplicated {};
  dictionary Duplicated {}; // oops!
</pre>

ReSpec warns if there are duplicated identifiers. You can read
the relevant error messages and the exact position of the errors when you click
the ReSpec pill. You can also click `[1]` to see where the erroneous IDL blocks
are.

### Constructor syntax

<pre class="idl">
  // Use new constructor() - can be autofixed!
  [Exposed=Window, Constructor]
  interface IHaveConstructor {
  };
</pre>

Recently Web IDL specification is changed to use new `constructor()` operation
syntax instead of previous `[Constructor]` extended attribute. Now ReSpec warns
when you use `[Constructor]`, and it also provides an automatically suggested
fix from the ReSpec pill! You can copy-paste the suggestion to fix IDLs and
voila! The error disappears.


### Implicitly exposed types

<pre class="idl">
  // Needs explicit [Exposed]
  interface ImplicitlyExposed {};
</pre>

Previously interfaces with explicit `[Exposed]` are considered as being
implicitly exposed to `Window` only. Now interfaces are required to exposed
explicitly, and thus ReSpec automatically suggests adding `[Exposed=Window]`.

### Optional dictionary argument

<pre class="idl">
  // optional dictionary argument
  // needs a default value
  dictionary MyDictionary {};
  [Exposed=Window]
  interface IUseTheDictionary {
    void doTheFoo(optional MyDictionary dict);
  };
</pre>

Similarly, ReSpec now suggest adding `= {}` because  optional dictionary
arguments are now required to have an explicit default value.

### Why just warnings, could it just fix everything for us?

* Changes should be reviewed, shouldn't be magic.

   We want authors to know what's exactly happening, and also there are cases
   that authors might want to review before applying the fix. For example,
   authors might want to add `[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]` instead of just
   `[Exposed=Window]` suggested from ReSpec.

* There is [a bot](https://github.com/w3c/payment-handler/pull/343) to fix IDLs for us.

   Because copy-paste is hard! It also helps non-ReSpec specifications to get
   correct IDLs.


## Algorithms
  - var pipe syntax
  - type annotations
  - variable highlighting

<ol class="algorithm" data-cite="infra">
  <li>Let the <var>string</var> be a DOMString.</li>
  <li>Let the fruits be a <a>list</a> of
      ¬´ "a", "b", "c" ¬ª.
  </li>
  <li>[=set/For each=] |letter:DOMString| in |set|.</li>
</ol>

## Pluralization / Singularizations

ReSpec knows `bananas` is a pluralized form of `banana`.

```
<dfn>Banana</dfn> <a data-lt="banana">bananas</a>
```

Previously we had to add `data-lt="banana"` to link `bananas` to `banana`, but
now you can just do `<a>bananas</a>` because ReSpec does it automatically.

It also works in a backward way, where `apple` automatically links to `Apples`:

```
<dfn>Apples</dfn> <a>apple</a>
```

## mdn integration
If your spec is documented on MDN, ReSpec can now display MDN support data directly in your specification. This is great for developers as they can see what browser implements a particular part of a spec, as well as giving direct access to developer documentation.

  - Simply add [config option](https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki/mdn) `mdn: true`

## Caniuse integration
ReSpec now supports caniuse.com integration, which shows up as a table at the top of your spec.

  - [config option](https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki/caniuse) `caniuse: "feature"` (where "feature" is the id used on caniuse to identify your spec).

You can also customize exactly which browsers show up.

```javascript
caniuse: {
  feature: "payment-request",
  browsers: ["chrome", "safari"],
},
```
