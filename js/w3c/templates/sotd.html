              Publication as {{anOrA}} {{textStatus}} does not imply endorsement by the W3C
              Membership. This is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or obsoleted by other

              This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C
              groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation.
              It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another
              document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the
              specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality
              and interoperability of the Web.

              document has satisfied the relevant technical requirements and is sufficiently stable to
              advance through the Technical Recommendation process.
